# Real-Time-Accompaniment üéµ

> ## üöß Work in Progress!
>
> This repository will host an AI-powered **Real-Time Accompaniment Generation** system that creates dynamic musical accompaniments on-the-fly. <br>
> The system will analyze live audio input played by a lead instrument (voice, piano melody, electric guitar, ...) and generate appropriate musical accompaniment in real-time. <br>
> Currently working on it, so feel free to **star** ‚≠êÔ∏è the repo to stay updated!

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Features (Planned)

- **Low-Latency Pipeline**: Optimized processing chain for minimal delay _(IN PROGRESS)_
- **Real Time MIDI Handling**: Real-time MIDI events handling _(IN PROGRESS)_
- **Rule-based Pipeline**: Baseline real-time pipeline. Weak but fast classifier _(TO DO)_
- **Deep Learning**: Deep learning models for refining predictions _(TO DO)_


## üì¨ Stay Updated

Development is actively ongoing. Hope you are as excited as I am!
